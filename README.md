## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.16] — 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Agent schema** — added a `maintenance_jobs` table for a durable background work queue and a `v_all_agents` view to unify execution paths.
- **Toolchain management** — added `toolchain_installations` to manage Node.js and uv downloads, and implemented robust `HOME` directory resolution and tilde expansion for agents.
- **Environment configuration** — added `global_env` and `global_paths` repositories to support global environment variables and a PATH editor.

### Changed

- **Agent database** — replaced legacy `acp_clients` by splitting agents into `local_agents` and `registry_agents`, bumped schema to v25, and migrated session tables to `events.db`.
- **OAuth authentication** — updated the MCP gateway to resolve OAuth metadata secrets from the OS keyring and updated secret tracking to link to local and registry agents.

## [0.3.15] — 2026-04-09

### Changed

- **CI infrastructure** — updated GitHub Actions workflows to skip linting and validation jobs for release and documentation commits.

### Fixed

- **Agent installations** — migrated registry installations from `npx` to `npm install -g` with a custom `.npmrc` to isolate cache and global operations within the app data directory, preventing macOS App Sandbox denials.
- **Auth terminals** — injected runtime execution paths into terminal sessions to ensure registry-installed agents can resolve bundled dependencies like Node.js during authentication flows.

## [0.3.14] — 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Runtime tracking** — added a `runtimes` database table to definitively track installed Node.js and uv paths, using `walkdir` to discover exact executable locations post-download.
- **In-app release notes** — added a UI section to display patch notes directly in the settings panel when an application update is available.

### Changed

- **ACP runtime resolution** — updated runtime path injection for registry-installed agents to securely resolve locations from the new `runtimes` database table instead of client metadata.
- **CI infrastructure** — migrated GitHub Actions workflows to use custom Warp runners and caching to improve build and test performance across all platforms.
- **Release pipelines** — updated the release pipeline to capture dynamically generated release notes and include them in the update payload.
- **Startup video loading** — simplified the intro video player to load assets directly via Vite instead of fetching and constructing blob URLs.
- **Automated signatures** — updated PR descriptions and changelog generation scripts to use current product branding.

## [0.3.13] — 2026-04-08

### Changed

- **ACP client state** — centralized configuration, connection probing, and session fetching into Zustand stores to simplify component architecture and state management.
- **MCP server state** — moved computation of installed registry metadata into the Zustand store to improve performance and code organization.
- **Agent runtime resolution** — migrated injection of bootstrapped registry paths to the Rust backend during capability probing and session fetching to ensure isolated runtimes are used.

### Fixed

- **NPX package installations** — fixed registry installation failures for scoped packages by properly stripping existing version suffixes before applying the pinned version.

## [0.3.12] — 2026-04-07

### Added

- **OAuth pre-registration** — added support for configuring pre-registered OAuth apps (e.g. GitHub) via a new Client ID field in MCP server settings.
- **Registry install progress** — added real-time progress bars to the registry browser during agent and server installations.
- **Secrets metadata tracking** — added a database table to track metadata, owner relationships, and expiration dates for all credentials stored in the OS keyring.
- **Combined logging** — introduced a unified `combined.log` file that captures all chronological logging output to simplify debugging.

### Changed

- **Keyring backend** — replaced `secret-lib` with `keyring-core` backed by platform-specific native stores (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service).
- **Keyring namespace** — updated the keyring service name to use the app bundle identifier, and added an automatic migration for legacy secrets on startup.
- **MCP settings UI** — redesigned the server list into a grid of cards with inline transport badges, update buttons, and clear OAuth authorization states.
- **Agent settings UI** — agent cards now display their configured default task instead of a generic description, and the entire card is clickable.
- **macOS runtime permissions** — quarantine xattrs on downloaded runtimes are now stripped in-process via `libc::removexattr` to prevent App Sandbox subprocess denials.
- **Unix shebang resolution** — scripts spawned on Unix now explicitly resolve their shebang interpreter against the injected PATH to ensure isolated runtimes are used.
- **Skill directory access** — security-scoped bookmark resolution for custom skill directories is now handled centrally in the backend during discovery.

### Fixed

- **OAuth 401 handling** — HTTP backends returning 401 Unauthorized now correctly prompt for OAuth authorization instead of recording generic connection failures.
- **Gateway synchronization** — the MCP gateway now automatically reloads backends immediately after a successful OAuth token exchange.
- **Redundant installations** — registry installations are now skipped if the requested version is already installed locally.
- **Registry errors** — registry browser error messages can now be manually dismissed and will automatically clear after 5 seconds.

## [0.3.11] — 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Remote MCP servers** — added registry support for installing and configuring remote MCP servers via HTTP/SSE transports.
- **Agent stderr capture** — agent child process stderr is now captured during initialization and injected into connection error messages for improved diagnostics.
- **Protocol message events** — JSON-RPC messages for initialization, session management, and authentication are now persisted as raw session events for auditing and replay.

### Changed

- **State management** — migrated frontend architecture from React Context to Zustand stores for themes, tabs, notifications, and settings to improve performance and code organization.
- **Windows CI performance** — expanded Windows Defender exclusions to cover Node.js, pnpm, and compiler processes for faster builds.
- **Release build profile** — changed link-time optimization (LTO) from full to thin to reduce compilation times.
- **Chat transcript retention** — updated the settings UI to provide a dropdown with common presets (10 days, 1 month, 1 year, forever) alongside custom day input.

### Fixed

- **Registry entry resolution** — entries not found in the local cache now trigger a fresh registry fetch or targeted search to correctly resolve remote-only servers.

## [0.3.10] — 2026-04-06

## [0.3.9] — 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Registry browser icons** — entry icons now display inline with agent/server names. Icons are resolved to data URIs at fetch time and cached. `dark:invert` applied for dark mode. Icon picker disabled for registry-installed agents.
- **View Logs button** — Settings → General now has a "View Logs" button that opens the app data directory in Finder/Explorer.
- **Spawn failure diagnostics** — cross-platform diagnostics when a child process fails to launch: file existence, permissions, PATH resolution, shebang/interpreter checks. On macOS: quarantine xattr, Gatekeeper assessment, code signature, and sandbox entitlement status.
- **Startup entitlements dump** — logs effective entitlements at startup via Security.framework for TestFlight debugging.
- **`ENTITLEMENTS.md`** — reference doc for both entitlement profiles.

### Changed

- **Structured logging** — removed `acp_log!`/`acp_debug!`/`acp_error!` macros (41 call sites), replaced with direct `tracing` calls using structured fields. Terminal lifecycle events promoted to `info`; agent stderr promoted to `warn` for release build visibility.
- **Project path opens directly** — clicking the project path pill in the session header now opens the directory (`openPath`) instead of revealing it in the parent folder.
- **unknownUpdate event type** — `event_type_str()` returns the actual type from raw JSON instead of hardcoded `"unknownUpdate"`.

### Fixed

- **Startup video interrupted** — intro video was cut short in release builds because `onComplete` callback changed on every render, causing effects to re-run. Stabilized via ref + `useCallback`.
- **Cmd+C / Ctrl+C copy** — keyboard copy wasn't reaching the WebView's native copy handler. Added a global keydown handler that writes plain text to clipboard via the Tauri clipboard plugin.
- **Registry agent icons lost on install** — `fetch_icon_data_uri` was trying to HTTP GET data URIs from cached registry entries, silently failing. Now passes through data URIs unchanged.
- **Registry agent runtime PATH** — `_extra_paths` from metadata wasn't being injected into spawn env vars. Fixed in backend (reads metadata from DB) and frontend (`buildAgentEnv` helper).

### Security

- **App Store entitlements** — added `files.user-selected.executable`, media folder access, microphone, Apple Events. Removed incorrect `inherit` and unnecessary hardened runtime exceptions.

## [0.3.8] — 2026-04-02

### Added
